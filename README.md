# FDefend - Femme Defend

## ENSEA HACKATHON Project

### Theme: Bettering Everyday Life

### Project Overview:
FDefend (short for Femme Defend) is an innovative mobile application developed for the ENSEA HACKATHON, aligning with the theme of "Bettering Everyday Life" and drawing inspiration from International Women's Day. The app aims to enhance women's safety and security by providing real-time information on unsafe areas within a 100km radius.

### Key Features:

1. **Unsafe Area Alerts:**
   - Utilizes GPS and a connected database to identify and mark areas within a 100km radius that may be unsafe for women.

2. **Emergency Button:**
   - Incorporates an emergency button that users can press to instantly call the police in case of an emergency. This feature ensures quick response and support.

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - The app updates information in real-time, keeping users informed about the safety status of different locations. Users can contribute by reporting incidents, making it a community-driven platform.

4. **Community Engagement:**
   - Fosters a sense of community by allowing users to share safety tips, experiences, and feedback. The app encourages a collaborative effort towards creating safer environments.

5. **In-App Resources:**
   - Offers resources such as self-defense tips, legal information, and contact details of support organizations to empower women with knowledge and assistance.

### Technology Stack:

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
